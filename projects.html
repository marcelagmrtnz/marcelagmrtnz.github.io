<a href=''>*Multi-Document Summarization</a>
<nobr class='project_year'> 2020 </nobr>
<ul>
    <li> Built in collaboration with other students as a part of a graduate level course </li>
    <li> Summarizes documents of a given document in approximatley 100 words </li>
    <li> Written in Python </li>
    <li> Utlizes TDIF scoring for content selection, multiple expert information ordering, regex based content compression, and BLEU score based redundancy limitation </li>
    <li> Utilizes NLTK (tokenization, BLEU scores), Splitta (sentence boundary detection), and more </li>
    <li>
    My contributions:
    <ul>
    <li> Handled initial data extraction with BeautifulSoup </li>
    <li> Added sentence boundary detection post-data extraction using NLTK/Splitta </li>
    <li> Helped to implement TFIDF scoring for content selection </li>
    <li> Wrote a Bash script to handle automated testing of our system </li>
    <li> Was very active in helping to debug the system as it was created </li>

<a href='https://github.com/marcusgabrielmartinez/esu-faq-phraselator' target='_blank'>Central Alaskan Yup'ik FAQ Voice Search</a>
<nobr class='project_year'> 2020 </nobr>
<ul>
    <li> Built as part of a Masters capstone project </li>
    <li> Allows users to search a bilingual FAQ from the Alaska Labor Standards and Safety Division's Wage and Hour - Employee FAQ with speech in English and Yup'ik</li>
    <li> Implemented in Python </li>
    <li> Search with English speech utilizes DeepSpeech's pre-trained English model and scorer </li>
    <li> Search with Yup'ik speech utilizes an acoustic model trained with DeepSpeech's fine-tuning capabilities (on the pre-trained English model), and their modified KenLM scorer creator was used to make the scorer </li>
    <li> Utilizes sounddevice, wavio, sox, PySimpleGUI, and more </li>
</ul>

<a href='https://bitbucket.org/uw575nlusds/text_adventure_dialogue/' target='_blank'>Dialogue Systems for Text Adventure Games</a>
<nobr class='project_year'> 2020 </nobr>
<ul>
    <li> Built as part of a graduate level course at the University of Washington in collaboration with two other group members </li>
    <li> Game logic built in Python, utilizing Rasa's ConveRT pipeline for NLU </li>
    <li> Uses a small text adventure game to show the accessibility and usability of NLU in games </li>
    <li> NLU allows players to use natural language when interacting with the game, unlike most text adventure games that require terse language </li>
    <li>
    My contributions:
    <ul>
    <li> Built the original NLU model using Rasa and our group's handmade utterances </li>
    <li> Researched how to interact with Rasa's NLU server system and wrote the initial toy script wrapper for our code to do this locally </li>
    <li> Wrote the JSON script file used to return game dialogue to the user </li>
    <li> Offered consultation to the group member who worked on the game logic in their design of the logic, especially as it pertained to the design of the script </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
