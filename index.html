<p> <b> Projects </b> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href='https://github.com/lonnystrunk/esu-grammar-engineering' target='_blank'>Central Alaskan Yup'ik Engineered Grammar</a>
<nobr class='project_year'> 2019 </nobr>
<ul>
    <li> Built in collaboration with Lonny Strunk and Dr. Emily Bender (instructor) as part of a graduate grammar engineering course </li>
    <li> A partial grammar engineered for Central Alaskan Yup'ik (esu) </li>
    <li> HPSG based, built in tdl using the LKB environment </li>
    <li> Built on research by Miyaoka, O. and Jacobson, S. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href='https://github.com/marcusgabrielmartinez/jane-austen-text-generator' target='_blank'>Stylized Random Text Generator</a>
<nobr class='project_year'> 2018 </nobr>
<ul>
    <li> Generates random sentences of changeable size in the style of author Jane Austen, based on text from three of her novels </li>
    <li> Built in Python, using a basic bigram language model to generate random text </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href='https://bitbucket.org/uw575nlusds/text_adventure_dialogue/' target='_blank'>Dialogue Systems for Text Adventure Games</a>
<nobr class='project_year'> 2020 </nobr>
<ul>
    <li> Built as part of a graduate level course at the University of Washington in collaboration with two other group members </li>
    <li> Game logic built in Python, utilizing Rasa's ConveRT pipeline for NLU </li>
    <li> Uses a small text adventure game to show the accessibility and usability of NLU in games </li>
    <li> NLU allows players to use natural language when interacting with the game, unlike most text adventure games that require terse language </li>
    <li>
    My contributions:
    <ul>
    <li> Built the original NLU model using Rasa and our group's handmade utterances </li>
    <li> Researched how to interact with Rasa's NLU server system and wrote the initial toy script wrapper for our code to do this locally </li>
    <li> Wrote the JSON script file used to return game dialogue to the user </li>
    <li> Offered consultation to the group member who worked on the game logic in their design of the logic, especially as it pertaind to the design of the script </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
